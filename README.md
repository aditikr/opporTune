# opporTune
OpporTune identifies songs using audio snippets from a microphone or an audio file which the user uploads. If it is not in the database, it will let the user know the song was not found and then prompt the user to add any information about the song to the database. The idea for OpporTune stems directly from Shazam, an app I use on a daily basis.
